Setting Up For Development
==========================

As described in the `origninal
post <https://geoanalytic.github.io/a-reference-server-for-geopaparazzi-cloud-profiles/>`__,
the system is built using
`docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`__ and
`cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. This
makes it really easy to get up and running with the potential to move to
a full production server when you are ready. Here are the steps required
to get a local version of the server running.

Before you begin, open a console window and create a directory to hold
the project source code and demo data you will download

::

    $ mkdir /grs
    $ cd /grs

1. Install cookiecutter

::

    $ pip install "cookiecutter>=1.4.0"

2. Run it against the latest repo for the reference server

::

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/geoanalytic/cookiecutter-geopaparazzi-server

You will be asked a number of questions, some of which are only
applicable to production systems. For development purposes, you should
enter ‘y’ to the following choices (these should be the defaults):

-  docker
-  celery
-  whitenoise

3) CD into the directory created by the cookiecutter process and then
   build and run the containers:

::

    $ cd geopaparazzi_reference_server
    $ docker-compose -f local.yml build
    $ docker-compose -f local.yml up -d
    $ docker-compose -f local.yml ps

If everything is working, the last command should result in a report
like this:

::

                        Name                                  Command               State           Ports         
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    geopaparazzi_reference_server_celerybeat_1     /entrypoint /start-celerybeat    Up                            
    geopaparazzi_reference_server_celeryworker_1   /entrypoint /start-celeryw ...   Up                            
    geopaparazzi_reference_server_django_1         /entrypoint /start               Up      0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp
    geopaparazzi_reference_server_flower_1         /entrypoint /start-flower        Up      0.0.0.0:5555->5555/tcp
    geopaparazzi_reference_server_postgres_1       /bin/sh -c /docker-entrypo ...   Up      5432/tcp              
    geopaparazzi_reference_server_redis_1          docker-entrypoint.sh redis ...   Up      6379/tcp  

What you see is six containers running within an isolated network that
allows the containers to communicate among themselves. Only the django
and flower containers are open to outside connections. Each container
does one thing:

-  django … provides the python based web framework
-  postgres … provides a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database
-  redis … provides a message broker and in memory cache for performance
   and to support celery tasks
-  celeryworker … provides an on demand asysnchronous processing
   capability
-  celerybeat … provides scheduled background processing capability
-  flower … provides a real-time monitoring tool for the celery tasks

4) Get the database and static assets set up, create a superuser

::

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django python manage.py collectstatic    
    $ docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django python manage.py createsuperuser    

The second command will prompt you to enter a username, email and
password for the superuser. You will need those credentials to access
the system so write them down!

5) Now load the demo data

Download the demo data from
`here <https://drive.google.com/open?id=12HwGhqdFNvZwS5Y6iO1dC81HWZQbsPnu>`__.
Note that you need to install `Httpie <https://httpie.org/>`__ and edit
the load_local.sh file, replacing ``user:password`` with the values you
provided for the superuser and your server IP address for the
``uploadurl`` entries.

::

    $ cd location/of/demo/data
    $ ./load_local.sh

Next, point your browser at http://localhost:8000/admin, login with your
superuser credentials and edit the Profiles and create Profilesets for
your superuser as described in the `original
post <https://geoanalytic.github.io/a-reference-server-for-geopaparazzi-cloud-profiles/>`__.

6) Connect Geopaparazzi to your server

You will need to figure out the IP address of the computer the server is
running on. On Linux, use the command ``hostname -I``. On Windows, the
command ``ipconfig`` should work. On your mobile, start the app and
select the settings (gear) icon, then select Cloud Server Settings and
fill in the user, password and Cloud Profiles URL as shown:

7) Download the cloud profiles
